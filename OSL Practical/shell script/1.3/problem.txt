Create an address book program using the bourne-again shell.
 It should use functions to perform the
required tasks. It should be menu-based, allowing you the options of:
1. Search address book
2. Add entries
3. Remove / edit entries.
You will also need a "display" function to display a record or records when selected.
Suggested record format: Use colons to separate fields.
