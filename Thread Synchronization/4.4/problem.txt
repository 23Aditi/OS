4.4 A real-world example of the readers-writers problem is an airline reservation system:
• Readers: want to read flight information
• Writers: want to make flight reservations
• Potential problem: if readers and writers can access the shared data simultaneously then
readers/writers may view flights as being available when they’ve actually just been booked.
Implement the solution using mutex and semaphore that controls access to the reader count and
database given the priority to readers over writers.
