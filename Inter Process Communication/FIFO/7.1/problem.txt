7.1 Implement two independent processes, Sender and Receiver, using Message Queues (FIFO). The Sender
accepts messages from the user and sends them to the queue with different message types. The Receiver
reads each message, converts it to uppercase, and displays it on the screen.
Ensure proper cleanup of message queues after execution.
