4.3 The Producer generates an integer between 0 and 9 (inclusive), stores it in a file. To make the
synchronization problem more interesting, the Producer sleeps for a random amount of time between 0 and
100 milliseconds before repeating the number-generating cycle. The Consumer consumes all integers from
the same file (the exact same file into which the Producer put the integers in the first place) as quickly as they
become available. The activities of the Producer and the Consumer must be synchronized in a following way:
The two threads must do some simple coordination. That is, the Producer must have a way to indicate to the
Consumer that the value is ready, and the Consumer must have a way to indicate that the value has been
retrieved. Implement the solution using mutex, and binary semaphore — to help threads wait for a condition
and notify other threads when that condition changes.
