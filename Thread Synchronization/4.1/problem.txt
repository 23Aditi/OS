4.1 The problem below describes two processes, the producer and the consumer, who share a common,
fixed-size buffer used as a queue.
The producer is Mr. Simpson whose job is to bake Pizza and consumer is Joey Tribbiani who consumes Pizza
at the same time. Both of them share common Pizza counter to interact with each other. The problem is to
make sure that the Simpson won't try to add more pizza on Pizza-counter if it's full. He needs to wait until
Joey consumes Pizza. Similarly, Joey can't consume pizza from an empty counter. He needs to wait until Mr.
Simpson adds Pizza on counter.
Implement a solution in C using POSIX threads that coordinates the activities of the producer Simpson and
the consumer Joey with counting semaphores and mutex.
