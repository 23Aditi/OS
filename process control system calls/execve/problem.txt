2.2 Implement the C program in which main program accepts an integer array. Main program uses the fork
system call to create a new process called a child process. Parent process sorts an integer array and passes
the sorted array to child process through the command line arguments of execve system call. The child
process uses execve system call to load new program that uses this sorted array for performing the binary
search to search the item in the array.
